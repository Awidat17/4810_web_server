# 4810_web_server

app.py is the python code.
templates contains all the html files that structure the web pages

When you run app.py, if the terminal states "Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ ", you'll need to aquire the usable ip adress another way. Once the devices actual ip adress is aquired, put the IP in a browser with the format "http://x.x.x.x:5000/" and you'll connect to the web server.
To get to the Project, add "/demo" to the end of the ip adress and you'll be good to go from there.
